            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One Day on the Upper West Side - A NYC Itinerary</h1><p>Spend a day strolling through the brownstone lined streets of the Upper West Side and you may feel like you have left NYC altogether. Heading uptown is almost like a vacation from the busyness of Midtown, and the pulsing life of downtown. The neighborhood is affluent, but laid back.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9922d66c931d0ec82bd65afab2c181638d1fab69.jpg"></article>]]></description>
