            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Much Does it Cost to Travel the World for a Year? My 2015 Expenses</h1><p>After I shared my year-end review of my 2015 travels, casually dropping my total expenditure into my rundown of statistics, a whole ton of you dropped me an email to ask for more details. Fortunately, I track every single cent that I spend while I'm on the road, so putting together a detailed breakdown of my year wasn't too much trouble.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3b78c145f418e86f859145a150b47db6328eda4a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cape Town Adventures - Robben Island</h1><p>There's nothing like it! The feeling of waking up and feeling excited about what today has in store for you. I was going to visit Robben Island. The prison island where Nelson Mandela had been imprisoned for so many years of his life. As soon as I got up, I got ready to go out.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c3506b260f4e031d7a8f5d81d60495f9a4c204e.png"></article>]]></description>

We didn't expect much of it, because many people have said there isn't much to do.
