description: "On the eastern side of the Cape Peninsula, you'll find the most beautiful little towns that are worth exploring. I started all the way down at Boulders Beach, which is located near Simon's town. Boulders Beach is where you'll find the African Penguins. Have a look at my previous post to see more about them."
